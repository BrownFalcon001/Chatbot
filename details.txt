We initialize a dictionary called session_memory to store conversation history for each session.
We use the session ID to uniquely identify each session and store the conversation history in the session_memory dictionary.
We retrieve the session ID using st.session_state.get() and create a new session ID if it doesn't exist.
We store the extracted text from the uploaded CV in the session memory dictionary under the corresponding session ID.
We access the stored CV text from the session memory dictionary when processing user queries to maintain context across interactions.
Each session's conversation history is preserved throughout the session, allowing the chatbot to provide personalized responses based on previous interactions with the user.
